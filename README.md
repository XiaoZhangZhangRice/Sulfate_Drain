# Background
Rice is an important crop in meeting global calorie demand but its production contributes to 12% of global methane emissions. Various technical options, especially in-season drainages, have been empirically demonstrated to reduce methane emissions. However, few studies have examined stacked practices such as the combination of drainage with other management strategies, representing a knowledge gap. Preseason sulfate addition to rice fields increases soil redox potential, disrupting early-season methanogenesis and reducing methane emissions. A single mid-season drain suppresses late-season methane emissions and reduces total emissions by about 50%. Hence, the combination of preseason sulfate application and mid-season drainage can potentially suppress methane emissions both early and late in the season. This stacked practice only includes one amendment application and one drain, representing an easy-to-implement and more importantly, scalable solution.

# Objectives
Primary: Evaluate preseason sulfate’s ability to suppress methane emissions in combination with a mid-season drain. Overall, we hypothesize that the sulfate with drain treatment will have the lowest cumulative seasonal methane emission.
Secondary: Quantify soil biogeochemical changes, specifically changes in sulfate concentrations and soil microbial communities over time.
# Treatments
CF – Continuous Flood
CFS – Continuous Flood, Preplant Sulfate
MD – Mid-season Drain
MDS – Mid-season Drain, Pre-season Sulfate
